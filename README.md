This project is a professional and responsive personal portfolio website developed using HTML and CSS. It is designed to showcase a developerâ€™s profile, skills, and featured projects in a clean and organized manner. The portfolio consists of multiple sections including an introduction with name and title, an "About Me" section providing background information and technical strengths, a "Projects" section that highlights individual work or contributions, and a "Contact" section that includes important links like email, GitHub, and LinkedIn. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across devices from desktops to smartphones. The design emphasizes simplicity and clarity, avoiding unnecessary animations or frameworks, making it ideal for beginners and developers who prefer a lightweight, fast-loading portfolio site. All styling is done using plain CSS, which makes it easy to customize and extend for future updates. This project serves as a foundational template that can be adapted by students, interns, or junior developers to establish a personal online presence.
